Lazyblog

What if you could blog... lazily? Just kidding, that's not what this actually is.

**Lazyblog** is a dead-simple CMS that allows you to use [ProseMirror](http://prosemirror.net/) to write the blog posts and pages on your site. Think of it as one step above static site generation... okay, maybe a half step.
