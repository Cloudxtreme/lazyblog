### Todo

1. Test coverage
2. Small refactors
3. Add cross-platform compile + release to CI
4. GH Pages Site + Docs
5. Stress-test again
6. Auto-increment IDs because Go is too fast sometimes
7. Don't do #6 because I don't think I like auto incrementing anymore
8. Figure out a viable alternative ID generation strategy, like Snowflake
9. Do #7 first because it's urgent
